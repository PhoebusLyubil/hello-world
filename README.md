Well, Hello world

I have planned to write about the steps and codes that I will use to invest and save some part of my income till I get retired. I have studied economics and currently I use R for statistical computation that I nedd, in future maybe I use Julia also. What I hope is that by doing this and getting feedbacks from others, I could save enough money for buying some land in a place with meditranian weather and turn it into a garden :)
